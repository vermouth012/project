        <h1>Growing Up, Moving Forward: The Life of Miguel</h1>
        
        
      <h2><u>Childhood Years</u></h2>
        <p><b>Miguel A. De Jesus</b> was an energetic, happy, and playful child who was always full of life.<sup>1</sup> 
          He was born and lived in Antipolo City with his parents.<sup>2</sup> He was very friendly and easily made friends, making his childhood filled with fun and laughter.<sup>3</sup> 
          Every afternoon after school, he would run outside to play with his friends, enjoying every moment before the sun went down.<sup>4</sup> His cousin introduced him to an anime called “Dragon Ball.” <sup>5</sup> 
          Miguel instantly fell in love with the show and started watching it as he grew up.<sup>6</sup> 
          He started school at the young age of four, first attending a small school in their <i>barangay</i> before transferring to a Catholic school near his house.<sup>7</sup> 
          Despite being busy with school, he always found time to enjoy his favorite childhood games.<sup>8</sup> 
          He loved playing traditional Filipino games such as <i>tumbang preso, pogs, and text</i> with his friends, spending hours outdoors.<sup>9</sup> 
          But among all the people in his life, his grandmother was the one he was closest to.<sup>10</sup> 
          She would always take him and his brother on trips around the city, making sure they experienced new and exciting places.<sup>11</sup> 
          Parks were one of their favorite destinations, where he could run and play freely under her care.<sup>12</sup> 
          She also spoiled him with delicious food, often treating him to snacks and cooking his favorite meals.<sup>13</sup> 
          He especially loved her <i>sinigang</i>, which always brought him comfort after a long day.<sup>14</sup> 
          His grandmother always made sure he ate well and never went hungry.<sup>15</sup> She was not only his caregiver but also his best friend and source of warmth.<sup>16</sup> 
          She took care of both him and his brother, giving them love and attention.<sup>17</sup> His family and friends’ kindness and generosity made his childhood even more special, and he cherished every moment.<sup>18</sup> 
          With a loving family and a fun-filled childhood, he grew up surrounded by happiness and adventure.<sup>19</sup> 
          His early years were a mix of exciting games with friends and heartwarming memories with his family.<sup>20</sup> 
          Those simple yet meaningful experiences shaped the joyful and loving person when Miguel was still a child.<sup>21</sup></p>

      <h2><u>Teenage Years</u></h2>
        <p>At the age of 13, Miguel felt a rush of excitement as he officially became a teenager and prepared to enter high school.<sup>1</sup> 
          He expected his world to change, but as the days passed, everything still felt normal.<sup>2</sup> 
          Thinking that high school academics would be much harder, he soon realized it was not as different as he had imagined.<sup>3</sup> 
          During his early high school years, he built strong friendships, forming a group with friends that made every day more enjoyable.<sup>4</sup> 
          One of his fondest memories from Grade 9 was having a friend who would always treat their group to food after a long day of classes.<sup>5</sup> 
          These small yet meaningful moments strengthened their bond, making high school filled with laughter and friendship.<sup>6</sup> 
          However, before Grade 9 ended, an unexpected ash fall from a nearby volcano disrupted their routine, leading to the suspension of classes for weeks.<sup>7</sup> 
          Just as they thought they could return to normal school life, the <strong>COVID-19</strong> pandemic hit the Philippines, changing everything.<sup>8</sup> 
          His Grade 10 year was spent entirely in online classes, a learning setup that he found incredibly boring.<sup>9</sup> 
          To make the experience more enjoyable, he and his friends would stay up all night, talking and playing online games.<sup>10</sup> 
          Even during class, they would be in a Discord call, keeping each other entertained while the lessons played in the background.<sup>11</sup> 
          Despite the distractions, he remained committed to his studies and achieved something he had never done before, earning a grade of 97 in all his major subjects.<sup>12</sup> 
          This accomplishment was especially meaningful since, during his elementary years, he had never received a grade higher than 90.<sup>13</sup> 
          Eventually, he graduated from junior high school through an online ceremony, marking the end of an unusual but memorable chapter in his life.<sup>14</sup> 
          His first year in senior high school, Grade 11, was also conducted fully online, which made him worried about how difficult it might be.<sup>15</sup> 
          However, he reminded himself to focus on the present rather than stress over the future.<sup>16</sup> 
          By Grade 12, a blended learning modality was introduced, allowing him to finally meet his classmates and teachers face-to-face.<sup>17</sup> 
          Having been isolated at home for so long, he developed social anxiety, making it difficult for him to adjust to in-person interactions.<sup>18</sup> 
          The first few weeks of face-to-face classes were nerve-wracking, and he often felt worried about engaging with others.<sup>19</sup> 
          But as time went on, he slowly adapted, made new friends, and successfully completed his thesis.<sup>20</sup> 
          By the end of the year, he proudly graduated from senior high school, marking the beginning of a new journey ahead.<sup>21</sup></p>
        
      <h2><u>College Years</u></h2>
        <p>Miguel was very indecisive when it came to choosing his college major.<sup>1</sup> After much thought, he realized that he had a stronger passion for computers and technology, which led him to choose information technology as his major.<sup>2</sup> 
          He decided to study at the <b>University of the East Manila</b>, but getting there every day was a big challenge.<sup>3</sup> 
          His daily commute took almost two hours, which meant he had to wake up at 4 a.m. and leave home by 5 a.m. to make it to his 7 a.m. classes.<sup>4</sup> 
          Friends suggested that he stay in a dormitory or condominium to make things easier, but he hesitated due to financial concerns and the idea of living with strangers.<sup>5</sup> 
          For the time being, he chose to endure the long commute, though he knew he might reconsider if his schedule became too difficult to manage.<sup>6</sup> 
          During his first week of college, he only had one close friend, and they often talked about how they would approach their blockmates and make new friends.<sup>7</sup> 
          However, an unexpected connection happened when a classmate sitting beside him introduced himself, and they discovered that they were both from Antipolo City.<sup>8</sup> 
          This small coincidence quickly started a conversation, and soon, Miguel and his friend bonded with their new classmates.<sup>9</sup> 
          As time passed, they formed a solid friendship, often waiting for each other at the train station so they could commute to class together.<sup>10</sup> 
          Despite getting used to the daily commute, the exhaustion always caught up to him, making him feel drained from lack of sleep.<sup>11</sup> 
          No matter how much he tried to rest, his schedule made it difficult, and fatigue became a constant struggle.<sup>12</sup> 
          By the end of his first year, he had successfully passed all his courses, but he still felt uncertain about his programming skills.<sup>13</sup> 
          Although he had learned the basics of coding, he found it challenging to develop logical thinking for problem-solving.<sup>14</sup> 
          To keep up with his coursework, he often relied on internet resources to complete his programming assignments.<sup>15</sup> 
          One of the biggest challenges he faced was the coding exam at the end of each semester, where he couldn’t rely on online help.<sup>16</sup> 
          However, with preparation and reviewing, he managed to pass these tests and even achieved high grades.<sup>17</sup> 
          Despite his academic success, his GPA wasn’t high enough to qualify for a scholarship, which he had hoped would help for his tuition fees.<sup>18</sup> 
          His college experience had been incredibly difficult, yet there were moments of joy from the friendships he built along the way.<sup>19</sup> 
          While the journey wasn’t as enjoyable as he had hoped, he remained determined to push through and continue moving forward.<sup>20</sup> 
          He knew that college was a crucial part of his future, and despite the struggles, he was committed to seeing it through. <sup>21</sup> 
          Though his experience so far had been tough, he held on to the hope that he would eventually succeed and reach the finish line. <sup>22</sup></p>
